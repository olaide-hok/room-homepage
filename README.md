## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension.

### Useful resources

- [BEM and SASS: A Perfect Match](https://andrew-barnes.medium.com/bem-and-sass-a-perfect-match-5e48d9bc3894) - This helped with BEM and SASS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Using Sass to Control Scope With BEM Naming](https://css-tricks.com/using-sass-control-scope-bem-naming/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand BEM. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
